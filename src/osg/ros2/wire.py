"""The protocol between the pipeline (py3.9) and the ROS bridge (py3.10).

`multiprocessing.connection` rather than HTTP or pyzmq: it is in the standard
library of both interpreters, so neither environment grows a dependency, and a
request/reply socket is all this needs. One client at a time, one round trip
per call, no queue.

Arrays are encoded explicitly as `{dtype, shape, bytes}` instead of being
pickled. A pickled ndarray carries the writing numpy's internal reconstruction
path, and the two sides here are different numpy builds (1.23 pinned in conda,
whatever apt ships on 3.10); the explicit form is also what makes a frame
payload readable in a traceback when something disagrees about a shape.

Frame payloads travel in ROS coordinates and ROS units -- raw depth, the camera
matrix as published, `T_map_cam` as TF reports it. Every conversion into the
pipeline's world lives in `frames.py`, on the OSG side, where it is unit-tested
without a ROS installation present. The bridge converts nothing.
