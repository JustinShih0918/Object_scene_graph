"""The two-pass protocol: navigate from a map the world has since invalidated.

This is what makes the benchmark a DYNAMIC-scene benchmark rather than an
incomplete-map one. Pass 1 explores the static layout and writes one snapshot
per scene; pass 2 runs the moved layout starting from that snapshot, so the map
the agent navigates with is genuinely stale -- it confidently says the object is
at A, and the object is at B.

The staleness IS the experiment. An agent that rebuilds from scratch every
episode is never wrong about anything, and measures nothing.
