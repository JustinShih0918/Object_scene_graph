"""DualMap's released HM3D benchmark: its trials, its targets, its success rule.

This module is the single definition of the benchmark both systems are scored
on.  `scripts/run_dualmap_released_native.py` drives the released DualMap
through it and `osg.sim.dualmap_env` drives ours, so "measured by the same
criterion" is a fact about the import graph rather than a claim in a document.

Three things live here and nowhere else.

  **The trial list.**  186 queries: 79 static (Appendix Table VIII), 54
  in-anchor and 53 cross-anchor (the released layout JSONs, minus the
  cracker-box trial the appendix does not report for `00880` `0128-2`).

  **What a query points at.**  YCB additions are placed by the layout files and
  are small enough that the released translation IS the object, so they carry a
  zero extent.  Every other static query is an HM3DSem class whose instances the
  release enumerates in `class_bbox.json` as full-size boxes.

  **The success rule.**  DualMap defines SR as stopping within one metre of the
  queried object, and for the dynamic splits within three attempts.  Measured to
  the box, not the centroid: the centre of a 2.33 m bed is more than a metre
  from any navigable floor, so a centroid rule would be unsatisfiable by
  construction for exactly the furniture classes the static split is made of.
