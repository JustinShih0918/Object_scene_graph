"""The terminal approach: walk to the object and decide where to stop.

This is the state that ends an episode, and the whole of the success metric
lives in it. HM3D scores success as the geodesic distance from the final pose to
the nearest sampled GOAL VIEW POINT -- not to the object -- and those viewpoints
sit on rings at fixed radii (0.8 / 1.2 / 1.5 / 2.0 m). Three distance-based
stopping strategies all stalled at dtg 0.107-0.147 m before that was understood,
which is why the code below prefers driving ONTO a ring to closing on the object
until its depth crosses a threshold.

Two mechanisms here belong to the dynamic-scene line rather than to navigation:

  the arrival sweep. A viewpoint is a pose the object is visible FROM, but the
  follower arrives on whatever heading the path ended with, and one frame from
  one heading is a thin basis for deciding an object is gone. Measured both
  ways: concluding absence from the arrival frame abandoned a bowl that was
  exactly where the map said, while stopping without looking declared success on
  empty space.

  and what the sweep deliberately does NOT do: apply a negative reading per
  frame. Twelve looks at the same object from the same pose are not twelve
  independent observations -- same range, lighting and viewing angle on the same
  geometry -- so multiplying their likelihoods turns one correlated detector
  failure into overwhelming evidence of absence. Doing it dropped SR from 0.429
  to 0.286. The sweep's job is to give the detector a chance, not to vote.

Ownership: this policy owns everything only an approach uses -- the retreat
pose, the step budget, the sweep counters, the bbox calibration log and the
navigation diagnostics. `NavAgent` remains the single owner of FSM state
(`state`, `_goal_xy`, `_candidate_id`), which this handler reads and writes
through `self.nav` exactly as any state handler must.
