"""Which storey the agent is on, and when to leave it.

Not part of the dynamic-scene line. This is the multi-floor work
(docs/MULTI_FLOOR.md), and it is here rather than in `nav_agent.py` because with
`floor.enabled=false` -- which is every YCB run and every default -- none of it
does anything except log, and 350 inert lines interleaved with `act()` made the
path an episode actually takes impossible to read off the file.

Nothing below is new. It is the same code, with the seams made explicit: the
policy answers questions and returns decisions, and `NavAgent` remains the only
thing that writes FSM state.

The one design point worth restating is why `costmap` lives here at all. A
single shared `Costmap2D` is what confined the pipeline to one floor: it bands
points by height above a `floor_y` latched on frame 1, so once the agent climbs,
every observation falls outside the band and is dropped -- no cells, no
frontiers, nothing to explore. `FloorStack` gives each storey its own grid, and
`costmap` is the seam: every consumer (planner, frontier extractor, room
segmenter, viewpoint planner, controller, the visualizers) still receives a
plain 2D `Costmap2D` and needs no knowledge that other floors exist.
