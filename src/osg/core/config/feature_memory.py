"""Matching an object by what it looks like, the way DualMap does.

Measured before it was written (`docs/FEATURE_MEMORY_PROBE.md`). Two findings
shape every default here.

The first is that a threshold does not work and an argmax does. Asked for an
absolute cosine that admits the mug without admitting the other fifty regions in
its frame, the answer was no threshold exists. DualMap never asks: on reaching an
anchor it takes `sorted_candidates[0]` over the objects near it and goes. So this
config has no admission bar. It has a radius, a minimum observation count, and a
budget.

The second is that our detector does propose the object, under the wrong name.
On the 160 dumped mug frames a box small enough to BE the mug covers it on 39,
labelled `towel` 27 times -- our equivalent of the `speaker` detection DualMap's
mug result rests on. Ranking every detection in a frame by cosine to "a photo of
a mug" picks that box on 27.8% of frames in the 2.5-4 m band. Per frame that is
weak; DualMap wins because it ranks 3D objects accumulated over several views
and scoped to one piece of furniture, which is what `local_pick_on_arrival` does.

    # DualMap never faces this: its detector proposes the small object (its mug
    # arrives labelled `speaker`), so its local map holds tight crops and the
    # argmax runs over things that are already object-shaped. Ours mostly
    # proposes the furniture the object rests on, so the bound is applied here,
    # from mapped geometry alone -- no ground truth, no per-target tuning.

    # thing four times and never seen it again". Ours can: presence.p is a
    # graded, recoverable belief that something is still where the map says, and
    # it is exactly the channel an appearance match lacks. A track that looks
    # like the query but has been quietly decaying should lose to one that looks
    # slightly less like it and is still believed.

    # The cosine is not a probability and must not be multiplied as one -- CLIP
