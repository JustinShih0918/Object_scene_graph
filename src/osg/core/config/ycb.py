"""`ycb` group: the authored dynamic-scene benchmark.

Runtime discovery of the collector's layouts, deterministic episode generation,
and the two knobs the dynamic protocol turns on: `relocate_at_step` for a move
the agent can witness, and `map_out`/`map_in` for the two-pass protocol where
pass 2 navigates from a map that pass 1 built and the world has since
invalidated. The staleness IS the experiment.
