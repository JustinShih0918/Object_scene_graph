"""`verification` group: the VLM gate, and absence as an observation.

Two distinct mechanisms share this group. The candidate gate asks "is this the
target"; the absence block asks "is it still there", which is the dynamic-scene
question -- the VLM enters as a second sensor with its own measured (r, q)
rather than as an override. See `osg/verification/absence.py`.
