"""`ros2` group: the robot, and everything about it that has to be checked.

Almost every field here is a question that can only be settled against the real
Stretch -- which topic the aligned depth comes out on, which way the head
camera is rotated, whether the base takes velocity on `/stretch/cmd_vel`. They
are config rather than constants precisely for that reason: the verify-on-robot
list in docs/ROS2.md is this dataclass, and settling one of those questions is
a yaml edit, not a code change.

See `osg/ros2/` for the bridge and `sim/ros2_env.py` for the env.
