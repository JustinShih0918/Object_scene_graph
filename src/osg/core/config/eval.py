"""`eval` group: which benchmark runs, over which episodes, with what recorded.

`mode` picks the benchmark: `objectnav` is the standard HM3D dataset,
`ycb_authored` is the dynamic-scene benchmark built from authored layouts.
`attempts` is the protocol knob -- DualMap allows a query several navigation
attempts and scoring one is a stricter protocol than the system being compared
