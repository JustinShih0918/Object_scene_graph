"""Find the object when the detector will not name it.

21 of the 50 remaining failures are perception: the target in view, often close
and centred and fully visible, and never named. Measured on the dumped
keyframes where the object's pixel is known
(`scripts/probe_perception_gap.py`), the detector is not mislabelling the
object so much as never proposing it. A proposal tight enough to BE the object
rather than the furniture under it comes from YOLOE on 0% of scissors frames,
20% of cracker box, 25% of soup can, 48% of banana -- and from FastSAM-s on
72/92/100/87%. What YOLOE calls the boxes that DO cover the object says the
rest: scissors `mirror` x26, soup can `lamp` x32, banana `chair` x87. It
proposes the furniture.

That is DualMap's structural advantage measured on our own frames: its detector
emits a tight crop and every stage downstream inherits it.

So: segment class-agnostically, rank the regions by appearance against the
query text, and hand the winner back as an ordinary Detection under the target
label. Everything downstream -- admission, the presence filter, the identity
channel, the candidate gate, the VLM, the attempt protocol -- then judges it
exactly as it judges the detector's own output. Nothing here can stop an
approach or score a trial by itself.

The measured limits, which are the reason this is threshold-gated and capped:

* Appearance can only pick the region out for compact objects. Ranking the true
  region against every other region in the frame (median 59 of them), rank-1 is
  91% for cracker box, 60% soup can, 39% banana -- and 3% for scissors, whose
  region scores 0.149 against distractors. Thin metal at two metres carries too
  little signal for the encoder, and no proposer fixes that.
* A threshold exists at 0.24: 40 correct admissions against 7 wrong, 85%
  precision, 24% recall. Below it precision collapses, above it recall does.
* Crop treatment matters as much as the encoder. Padding the box by a quarter
  of its longer side and asking for "a pair of scissors" rather than "a photo of
  a scissors" moves overall rank-1 from 52% to 70%. ViT-B/32 is worse than
  MobileCLIP-S2 at every setting tried.
