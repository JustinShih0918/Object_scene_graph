"""What actually drives, behind `Nav2Driver`: the robot, or habitat.

Two backends, one contract (`observe`, `send_goal`, `poll`, `cancel`). Having
the simulated one at all is what makes the ROS path debuggable: the goal
selection, the ownership handshake and the FSM's response to an aborted goal
can all be exercised in habitat, where there is ground truth and a repeatable
episode, before any of it meets a robot.
