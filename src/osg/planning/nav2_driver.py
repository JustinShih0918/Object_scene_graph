"""The mover that hands the goal to somebody else.

Every other mover in this repo converts a metric goal into the next discrete
action: the costmap planner plans and steers, PointNav infers one, the navmesh
follower is told one by habitat. On the Stretch none of that is wanted -- the
robot already runs Nav2, which has the robot's own footprint, its local
costmap, its recovery behaviours and a controller tuned for the base. The
pipeline's job ends at "go here".

So `Nav2Driver` is `PointNavDriver`-shaped (`planning/pointnav_driver.py:80`)
but decides nothing: `step(goal_xy)` posts the goal and reports what the
navigator says about it. Being that shape is what lets it slot into
`NavAgent`'s existing `pointnav` branch (`nav_agent.py:1574`, `:2010`) with no
change to the FSM at all -- and it is the reason the `NavStep` reason vocabulary
is reused rather than extended: `aborted` is the pipeline's `policy_stop`, which
the FSM already knows how to treat as a blocked frontier.

The backend is what differs between the robot and habitat, so the state machine
above it is tested once, against a fake (tests/unit/test_nav2_driver.py).
