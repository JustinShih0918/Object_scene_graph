        previously tried viewpoints (e.g., where the detector could not see
        the object due to 3D occlusion the 2D map misses).

        `obj_radius_m` measures the rings from the object's estimated SURFACE
        rather than its centre, and `radii` replaces the configured ladder for
        one call (a close look wants a single 1.5 m ring). The radii were chosen
        for tabletop YCB objects,
        whose extent is a few centimetres and so does not matter; on a couch or a
        counter the centre can be a metre inside the furniture, and a ring drawn
        around it puts every sample inside the object. Passing the track's
        horizontal semi-axis pushes the whole ladder outwards by that much, which
        is what lets the innermost ring be small enough to score without the goal
        landing in an occupied cell. 0.0 reproduces the original behaviour.

        The two relaxations exist for the fallback in `_start_approach`, and
        both are about the difference between "I know this is bad" and "I do not
        know yet". `allow_unknown` accepts UNKNOWN cells: unmapped is not
        unstandable, and the navmesh follower will find out for real. Dropping
        `require_line_of_sight` accepts a pose whose ray to the object crosses
        occupied cells, which on a 2D costmap includes the object's own
        supporting table. A relaxed viewpoint is a worse place to stand than a
        strict one; it is a far better place than the object's own centre, which
