"""Our stack, on DualMap's released benchmark, under DualMap's own rules.

`ycb_authored` runs the authored layouts through episodes this repository
generates: it samples its own starts, scores at its own success distance, and
answers questions about our system. It cannot answer "how do the two systems
compare", because nothing in it is shared with the other system's run.

This mode is the other half. Every input that defines a trial is taken from the
released benchmark or from the DualMap run already measured against it:

  the 186 queries and the layout injected for each come from
  `osg.eval.dualmap_release`, the same module the DualMap harness imports;

  the start pose comes from that DualMap run's own per-trial record, so both
  systems answer the same query from the same place in the same world;

  and a stop is scored by `distance_to_target` at `SUCCESS_DISTANCE_M`, within
  three attempts -- DualMap's definition, in DualMap's code, not ours.

What is NOT shared is the agent's embodiment: our navmesh is cut for a 0.88 m
agent and DualMap drove a 1.5 m one, so a start pose from the other system is
snapped onto this navmesh (the offset is recorded per trial) and the optimum
path is recomputed here rather than copied. Both optima are written down so the
difference is measurable instead of assumed.
