"""The staircase the prior map already walked, read back.

`save_map` writes every committed floor transition into the prior map's
`connectivity`, and `apply_map` restores them into `FloorStack.stair_edges`.
Until `floor.use_prior_stairs`, nothing consumed them: an agent that knew
exactly where the stairs were still had to rediscover them by chance.

Measured on outputs/osg_authored_15, that chance is poor. Of 11 cross-floor
episodes, 4 never saw a portal and never attempted a switch, and across the run
405 storey requests produced 12 attempts.
