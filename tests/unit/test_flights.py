"""A staircase read off the height layer, so the target is its foot.

Stage 4's detector asked which cells are steppable by their local height step
and fragmented every flight into riser edges, because a tread's interior is
flat. This asks which cells sit strictly between this floor and the next and
are contiguous, and keeps a run only if its heights span a metre: a table is a
plateau, a flight joins two storeys.

The detector's `stairs` mask, seen from below, put its target 2.7 m beside the
true foot on 00821, and twelve climbs steered at it rose 0.00 m. The lowest cell
of an intermediate-height run IS the foot.
