"""The order of the two systems: test the stale anchor, then choose a storey.

`_select_surface` aggregates container mass per floor and asks FloorPolicy for
the argmax. That mass is affinity x proximity over MAPPED SURFACES, so with a
flat proximity prior it reduces to "which storey has more furniture" -- a fact
about the prior map, available on the first selection round, and independent of
anything the agent has observed this episode.

Measured on outputs/osg_authored_15 (30 episodes, two storeys, presence and the
search posterior both on): the first cross-floor request came at step 13 in 17
of 30 episodes, including 10 of the 19 whose object never left the start floor.
405 requests produced 12 directed switch attempts and 3 arrivals on the goal
floor, while the presence filter spoke 4 times in 30 episodes. The agent was
leaving before it had been anywhere.

These tests pin the ordering: while a target-labelled track on this floor is
still believed AND has not been visited, the storey question is held.
