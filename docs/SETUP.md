# Setup: the repo, the submodule, and the model weights

Everything below runs inside the `nav` container (`README.md` → Quick start).
Two things this repo does **not** contain and cannot run without: the ASCENT
reference checkout (a pinned submodule) and ~5 GB of model weights (downloaded).

---

## 1. Clone with the submodule

`relative_work/ascent` is a submodule pinned to
[Zeying-Gong/ascent](https://github.com/Zeying-Gong/ascent) at `8f7bbf9`. It is
where the five perception models live, so nothing runs without it.

```bash
git clone --recursive <this repo>
# already cloned without --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**`--recursive` is not optional, and the image build needs it too** — the
Dockerfile does `COPY relative_work/ascent /opt/ascent` and fails outright if
the submodule is not checked out, which is deliberate: a silently partial image
would fail much later and far less clearly. ASCENT itself carries nine nested
submodules (GroundingDINO, MobileSAM, D-FINE, RAM++, places365, vlfm,
frontier_exploration, depth_camera_filtering, habitat-lab), and a non-recursive
clone leaves all nine as empty directories. The servers import from them.

### The compiled CUDA extension (only for pre-merge containers)

The merged image builds it at image-build time, so a container from
`docker/Dockerfile` already has it. The rest of this section applies only if
you are on an older container or building the extension by hand.


GroundingDINO ships a CUDA op (`MultiScaleDeformableAttention`) that must be
**built in the working tree**. It is not in git, so a fresh clone does not have
it, and the failure is not obvious — the server starts, answers its health
check, and then returns HTTP 500 on the first real frame with

```
NameError: name '_C' is not defined
```

which the run surfaces as `PerceptionUnavailable: …/gdino: HTTP Error 500`.
Build it once, in the `ascent` env:

```bash
/workspace/.conda-envs/ascent/bin/pip install -e relative_work/ascent/third_party/GroundingDINO
```

It produces `third_party/GroundingDINO/groundingdino/_C.cpython-39-*.so`; check
that file exists before blaming the model.

---

## 2. `docker/.env`

`docker/.env.example` lists every variable `compose.yaml` reads. Two must be
set by hand:

```bash
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
printf 'UID=%s\nGID=%s\n' "$(id -u)" "$(id -g)" >> docker/.env
```

- **`UID` / `GID`** — the image builds its non-root user with these, and
  `/workspace` is a bind mount of your checkout. Get them wrong and the
  container cannot write `outputs/`. They cannot be inherited from your shell:
  `UID` is a bash built-in that is **not exported**, so compose never sees it
  and silently falls back to 1000.
- **`HM3D_SCENES`** — where the license-gated scene meshes live, mounted onto
  `data/versioned_data`. Wrong or unset, the eval does not report a missing
  file; it dies in the env worker with `No Stage Attributes exists for
  requested scene ...basis.glb`.

`NVIDIA_API_KEY` is only needed for `verification=nim`, which is off in the
default arm. The collector paths only matter for the `ycb_*` experiments.

## 3. Model weights

Nothing is committed. `pretrained_weights/` inside the submodule is gitignored,
and so is `data/`.

### The five served models + the mover

```bash
bash scripts/fetch_ascent_weights.sh        # -> relative_work/ascent/pretrained_weights/
```

| file | size | used by | source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth` | 662 MB | stair detector (:13184) | GroundingDINO v0.1.0-alpha release |
| `ram_plus_swin_large_14m.pth` | 2.9 GB | RAM++ tagger (:13185) | HF `xinyu1205/recognize-anything-plus-model` |
| `dfine_x_obj2coco.pth` | 240 MB | D-FINE detector (:13186) | Peterande/storage dfinev1.0 |
| `mobile_sam.pt` | 39 MB | mask per detection (:13183) | linked from `data/weights/` |
| `rednet_semmap_mp3d_40.pth` | 626 MB | stair segmentation | linked from `data/weights/` |
| `resnet50_places365.pth.tar` | 93 MB | room labels (in-process) | linked from `data/place365/` |
| `pointnav_weights.pth` | 32 MB | the frozen mover | linked from `data/weights/` |

The script links the four this repo already has and downloads the other three;
run it again any time — it skips what is present. **BLIP-2** (the value map and
commit gate, :13182) is not a file here: `lavis` pulls it from HF on the
server's first start, which is why that server takes longest to come up.

It also offers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (~15 GB) for ASCENT's own LLM server. **You
do not need it**: both this repo and the reference call `qwen2.5:7b` on the
local ollama instead. Skip it unless you are running native ASCENT with its
bf16 server.

### The OSG-side weights

```bash
python scripts/download_weights.py                 # detector + mobileclip
python scripts/download_weights.py --pointnav      # the mover
python scripts/download_weights.py --rednet        # stair segmentation
python scripts/download_weights.py --clip          # value-map image-text model
```

### The LLM

```bash
docker exec docker-ollama-1 ollama pull qwen2.5:7b     # 4.7 GB, Q4_K_M
```

Note it is **quantised** — ASCENT's paper configuration is bf16. Both sides
here use the same quantised model, so comparisons between them are fair; see
`docs/METHODOLOGY.md` §5.4.

### Datasets

```bash
python scripts/download_data.py --username <TOKEN_ID> --password <TOKEN_SECRET> \
    --uids hm3d_val_v0.2
python scripts/download_data.py --episodes-only
```

HM3D scenes need a free licence from
https://matterport.com/habitat-matterport-3d-research-dataset.

---

## 4. Check it works

```bash
bash scripts/serve_perception.sh                     # five servers, ~60 s to load
python scripts/run_eval.py eval.num_episodes=1       # one live episode
```

A green run prints one `[1/1] … success=…` line. If it raises
`PerceptionUnavailable`, the named port tells you which model is unhappy;
`relative_work/ascent/debug/vlm_logs/<name>.log` has the server-side traceback.

Total on disk: ~5 GB of weights, ~1 GB of nested submodule source, plus HM3D
scenes (~10 GB for val).

---

## 5. The two conda environments

One image, two environments — `docker/Dockerfile` builds both:

| env | python | torch | for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `habitat` (default on shell entry) | 3.9 | 2.4.1+cu121 | habitat-sim, OSG, YOLOE, the eval harness |
| `ascent` | 3.9 | 2.1.0+cu118 | BLIP-2, MobileSAM, GroundingDINO, RAM++, D-FINE, and the native reference |

They cannot be one interpreter: habitat-sim 0.3.1 pins numpy < 1.24, lavis
needs a transformers the OSG side does not want, and the torch builds differ.
That is exactly why the models are served over HTTP rather than imported.

`scripts/serve_perception.sh` finds the ascent env at
`/opt/conda/envs/ascent`, falling back to a workspace-local
`.conda-envs/ascent` for containers built before the two Dockerfiles were
merged. Override with `ASCENT_PYTHON=…`.

Verify both are intact:

```bash
python -c "import habitat_sim, torch, ultralytics; print('habitat env OK')"
$ASCENT_PYTHON -c "
import habitat_sim, lavis, mobile_sam, groundingdino.util.inference, ram
from groundingdino import _C
print('ascent env OK')"
```

The base image is `nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-cudnn8-devel`, not a `-runtime-` one:
GroundingDINO's kernel needs nvcc, and torch refuses to build an extension when
nvcc's version differs from `torch.version.cuda` — so nvcc must be 11.8 to
match ASCENT's cu118 torch. The habitat env's cu121 torch is unaffected because
torch wheels bundle their own CUDA runtime and nothing on the OSG side compiles
an extension.

## 6. What the submodule does and does not carry

The submodule is pinned to **upstream, unmodified**. During this work the
checkout carried three local patches which are deliberately no longer applied:

| patch | what it did | consequence of dropping it |
|---|---|---|
| behaviour recorder (+94 lines in `ascent_policy.py`, `ascent_trainer.py`, `llm_planner.py`, plus `behaviour_recorder.py`) | produced ASCENT's per-step trace | the reference trace cannot be regenerated. The trace **itself is preserved** in this repo at `data/reference/ascent_behaviour_100/` (gzipped, 772 KB), which is what `scripts/compare_ascent_osg.py` reads by default |
| a lock in `model_api/server_wrapper_out.py` | serialised model calls | the servers are **not reentrant** again. GroundingDINO caches per-image state on the module, so two concurrent evals race and the loser gets HTTP 500. **Run one evaluation at a time.** This repo's client retries once, which covers a transient hit, not sustained concurrency |
| `model_api/qwen25_ollama.py` | served ASCENT's Qwen endpoint from ollama | only matters when running native ASCENT; its own launcher expects the bf16 server |

Nothing in this repo's own pipeline depends on those patches — verified by a
live episode against the clean submodule after the conversion.
