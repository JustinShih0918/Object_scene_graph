# The fused proposal arm on the full 107

> **Superseded by [`PROPOSAL_FUSION_CLS_RESULT.md`](PROPOSAL_FUSION_CLS_RESULT.md).** This is
> the `fuse` arm at 59/107; `fuse_cls` reached 62/107 and is the arm that shipped
> (`configs/experiment/dualmap_osg_unified.yaml`). Kept for the paired comparison.

run `outputs/osg_v4_fuse_full` vs reference `outputs/osg_sensor_v2_full`, paired on 107 trials

| condition | v2 | fuse | delta | +/- |

## Reading

**Headline: 59/107 (55.1%)** -- `_sensor_v2` 57, the privileged navmesh arm 56,
DualMap 51. In-anchor 33/54, cross-anchor 26/53.

The +2 total is inside the benchmark's +-3 noise floor and is not, on its own,
a finding. What is a finding is where the trials moved, because every one of
the eight is attributed by the commit log:

* **The perception subset went 0 -> 5 of 21.** Those 21 are the trials the
  detector never names, where every arm before this one scored exactly 0 --
  the bucket was structurally closed. All five conversions scored through a
  proposal-only commit: two cracker boxes, two soup cans, and one **scissors**
  (cross_anchor 0128-2 in 00880: the 22-observation, 0.330 track from the
  observation run), which every earlier probe had written off as unreadable
  by the encoder.
* **The other 86 went 57 -> 54**, and all three losses are phantom commits
  that exhausted the attempts: bowl and plate in 00829's cross-anchor layout
  0129-1 -- the layout the observation run flagged as phantom-heavy (bowl
  produced 36 of 70 phantoms) -- and the 00848 in-anchor mug, where v2 named it
  late and the phantom spent the attempts first.
* 29 proposal-only commits in 24 episodes cost 21 attempts and scored 9.

So the fusion does what it was built to do -- convert the trials the label
path cannot reach -- and its price is three trials in known-bad layouts. The
per-frame stage that lost 18 became a fused stage that wins 5 and loses 3,
with the named path bit-identical to v2 everywhere a proposal did not commit.

**The lever left is the bar.** The observation tables put (4, 0.30) at 1
phantom episode in 37 against 5 at (4, 0.28), keeping 3 of the 8 true tracks;
the three losses here all sit below 0.30 while the scissors, mug and banana
true tracks sit above it. That is a defensible next arm, run on the full 107,
not read off this one. Lowering the per-frame observation bar (0.24) so weaker
objects accumulate a mean is the other, separate arm.

Provenance: `_sensor_v4_fuse`, commit a0ff0d0 and before; identity of the
named path verified on 43 trials with commits off (`docs/PROPOSAL_FUSION.md`).
