# DualMap's route, transplanted: what happened and why

The probe (`docs/FEATURE_MEMORY_PROBE.md`) ended by saying that threshold-based
admission is refuted but DualMap's actual mechanism -- argmax over accumulated
objects near a reached anchor -- was untested. This is that test.

## What was built

`feature_memory.local_pick_on_arrival`. On arriving at a searched surface with no
candidate from the label path, rank the live tracks near it by cosine between the
query text and their accumulated CLIP image feature, and commit to the best.
Argmax, never a threshold: `sorted_candidates[0]`, as in DualMap's
`find_best_candidate_with_inquiry`. The pick is a proposal and not a verdict --
reachability, the VLM, the identity channel, the absence sensor and the attempt
protocol judge it exactly as they judge a candidate the label proposed, and
nothing here can stop an approach on a cosine.

Three arms, all off the shipped `island_close` configuration, all on the 24
dynamic mug and scissors trials (`data/splits/dualmap_mug_scissors.json`):

* `_feat` -- the pick, on cosine alone. DualMap's rule.
* `_featp` -- fused with the presence belief, which DualMap has no equivalent of:
  its memory of a failed candidate is an ignore list discarded when the query
  ends, so its argmax cannot say "I have walked past that and never seen it
  again". Score becomes `exp(-beta * (best - sim)) * presence.p`, never the
  cosine as a probability.
* `_featsz` -- the pick bounded to tracks small enough to be the object.

## Result

| slice | base | `_feat` | `_featp` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| mug in-anchor | 3/3 | 1/3 | 1/3 |
| mug cross-anchor | 2/3 | 3/3 | 2/3 |
| scissors in-anchor | 2/9 | 3/9 | 0/9 |
| scissors cross-anchor | 1/9 | 1/9 | 2/9 |
| **total** | **8/24** | **8/24** | **5/24** |

The mechanism is not inert: 44 picks over 24 trials, every one committed, 835
tracks considered. The presence fusion changed the answer 10 times and lost
three trials doing it. `_feat` is a flat null on a subset whose noise floor is
about three trials.

## Why, and it is not the matcher

Two measurements say the same thing from different ends.

**Our search does not stand where the object is.** Counting every surface the
search arrived at, and how many were within 2 m of the object:

| query | surfaces arrived at | within 2 m | picks fired | picks within 2 m |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| mug | 19 | 1 | 11 | **0** |
| scissors | 92 | 10 | 30 | 3 |

DualMap's global text match commits to `dining table` on all 21 of its mug
trials across three seeds and ends 0.33-0.94 m from the mug. Its local inquiry
then only has to choose among the things on that table. Transplanting the local
half into a search that arrives somewhere else just commits to whatever is
nearest, and the object is not there to be chosen.

**What it picks is furniture.** Of 44 picks: pillow 13, lamp 5, bench 4, picture
4, chair 4 -- 37 of 44 furniture-sized. This is not the cosine misbehaving; a
crop of a bed genuinely is a better match for "a photo of a mug" than forty
pixels of the real mug beside it. DualMap never meets the problem because its
detector proposes the small object: its mug arrives labelled `speaker`, a tight
crop, and its local map is full of object-shaped things. Ours mostly proposes
the furniture the object rests on -- on the 160 dumped mug frames a box small
enough to BE the mug covers it on only 39, and one covering the pixel at all on
84, the rest being cabinets and beds whose boxes happen to contain it.

`_featsz` addresses the second of these with a bound from mapped geometry alone
(`local_max_extent_m: 0.6`; every movable query here is under 0.3 m across). It
cannot address the first.

## What this says about the gap

The chain is region proposal, then feature match, then anchor choice. DualMap
wins the mug at the first link, not the third: because its detector emits a tight
region on the object, its features describe the object, so its global anchor
inherits a mug-like feature and its local argmax has a mug-shaped thing to find.
Our features describe the furniture, so every stage downstream inherits that.

The matching method was never the difference. Adding it changes nothing on its
own, which is what these arms measure.
