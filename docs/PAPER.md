## Abstract

Object-goal navigation in changing indoor environments requires robots to recover targets
relocated within or across floors. Previously observed object locations can become outdated,
requiring agents to revise their scene memory during search. We introduce MD-SG, an online,
open-vocabulary 3D scene graph navigation pipeline built around two complementary mechanisms:
(1) Presence-Belief Revision, which uses visibility-gated visual-geometric evidence to
reassess remembered object locations, and (2) Belief-Guided Search and Unified Selection,
which combines scene-graph priors with inspection evidence to balance candidate inspection
and frontier exploration. Integrated within a floor-aware scene graph, these mechanisms allow
the agent to reject outdated locations and redirect search within or across floors. On
single-floor cross-anchor relocation tasks in HM3D, MD-SG achieves a success rate of 52.8%,
compared with 30.2% for DualMap re-evaluated under the same protocol. We further introduce a
cross-floor relocation benchmark comprising 25 episodes across five scenes, on which MD-SG
achieves a success rate of 40.0%. A real-world demonstration additionally illustrates
recovery after object relocation. These results highlight the value of revisable scene
memory.

## I. Introduction

Object-goal navigation (ObjectNav) requires an embodied agent to navigate an unknown indoor
environment and locate an object specified by its semantic category or natural-language
description. However, most ObjectNav systems assume that objects remain stationary, whereas
humans and robots frequently relocate objects within or across floors in real environments.
For example, a cup previously observed in an upstairs bedroom may later be moved to a
downstairs kitchen. Humans can handle such changes by remembering the scene structure and
revising their knowledge of object locations. Three-dimensional scene graphs (3DSGs) provide
objects and their attributes as nodes and their relationships as edges. However, most
3DSG-based ObjectNav systems cannot revise outdated object locations, particularly when
objects move across floors. An effective agent must recognize that its prior knowledge is no
longer valid, search for the relocated object, and update its scene representation
accordingly.

Existing ObjectNav methods generally rely on semantic maps or 3DSGs. Semantic-map methods
such as VLFM [1] estimate the semantic relevance of exploration frontiers and project these
scores onto a 2D value map to guide navigation. ASCENT [2] extends this approach with
floor-level abstractions and staircase transitions, enabling online operation across floors.
While effective for exploration, semantic maps provide limited support for representing and
reasoning about relationships among individual objects. In contrast, 3DSGs explicitly capture
object-level semantics and spatial structure. Hydra [3] enables real-time scene graph
construction, but its closed-set semantics restrict navigation toward arbitrary targets.
HOV-SG [4] supports open-vocabulary, hierarchical representations of multi-story
environments, while ConceptGraphs [5] introduces open-vocabulary object graphs for perception
and planning. Nevertheless, these methods primarily model static object configurations and
are not designed to revise outdated object locations during navigation. Existing approaches
therefore address open-vocabulary mapping, online navigation, and dynamic handling
separately, and do not jointly support these capabilities.

Dynamic multi-floor ObjectNav requires the agent to reason about both outdated object
locations and possible floor transitions. When a target is absent from its expected location,
the agent must invalidate that location, maintain alternative hypotheses, and determine
whether to continue searching locally or move to another floor, as illustrated in Fig. 1.
DualMap [6] takes an important step toward this problem by combining open-vocabulary
perception, online semantic mapping, and object-level updates. It maintains a global
anchor-based abstract map for candidate selection and constructs a local concrete map during
navigation. However, its representation is designed around single-floor environments and does
not model floor connectivity. It therefore cannot maintain and compare relocation hypotheses
across floors or determine when invalidating local candidates should trigger a floor
transition. This limitation highlights a broader gap in dynamic ObjectNav rather than an
issue specific to DualMap [6].

To address this gap, we introduce MD-SG, an online, open-vocabulary 3DSG-based navigation
pipeline for dynamic, multi-floor environments. Our central insight is that a map in a
dynamic environment must not only preserve prior knowledge but also recognize when that
knowledge has become incorrect. MD-SG therefore represents object locations as revisable
beliefs within a floor-aware 3DSG rather than as fixed entries. Visibility-gated observations
update these beliefs and invalidate outdated locations, while the floor-aware graph allows
target hypotheses to be maintained and compared across floors. When candidates on the current
floor are invalidated, MD-SG can redirect navigation toward another floor. By jointly
supporting belief revision and cross-floor reasoning, MD-SG allows robots to preserve useful
knowledge from prior exploration while adapting to environmental changes, an essential
capability for persistent operation in homes, offices, and other shared spaces. The full
pipeline is at Fig. 2.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

- We identify and formulate dynamic multi-floor ObjectNav, an overlooked setting in which
  objects may be relocated within or across floors and previously mapped locations can no
  longer be treated as fixed.
- We introduce MD-SG, an online, open-vocabulary 3DSG navigation pipeline that revises
  object-location beliefs and reasons over target hypotheses across floors.
- We establish, to our knowledge, the first ObjectNav benchmark specifically designed for
  dynamic multi-floor environments, featuring controlled same-floor and cross-floor object
  relocation. Experiments demonstrate improved target reacquisition over DualMap [6].

## II. Related Work

### A. Semantic Mapping and Multi-floor Exploration

Semantic mapping augments geometric maps with semantic cues that guide goal-directed
exploration within and across floors. VLFM [1] projects image–language similarity onto a
two-dimensional value map to rank exploration frontiers, and ASCENT [2] extends this frontier
reasoning to multi-floor buildings with hierarchical spatial abstraction and multi-floor
topology modeling. Both systems target the exploration of unfamiliar space. Recovering an
object from an outdated map poses a different challenge: previously observed locations can
mislead navigation, and the robot must reassess its memory as new evidence arrives. MD-SG
couples memory revision with multi-floor search, and evidence on one floor redirects
exploration across floors.

### B. Online and Dynamic 3D Scene Graphs

3D scene graphs organize spatial entities and their relationships into structured environment
memory, and recent work builds them online and maintains them under scene changes. Hydra [3]
demonstrates real-time hierarchical scene graph construction with closed-set semantics, while
ConceptGraphs [5] and HOV-SG [4] bring open-vocabulary semantics to object graphs and to
floor–room–object hierarchies for multi-story buildings. Clio [7] constructs open-set scene
graphs in real time and retains objects according to task relevance. These systems establish
the value of structured semantic memory. Target recovery from outdated object locations,
however, remains outside their scope. An early feature-based approach [8] models the
persistence of mapped landmarks in semi-static environments. Khronos [9] unifies short-term
motion and long-term scene changes within a spatio-temporal metric-semantic SLAM framework,
with a focus on temporally consistent reconstruction rather than goal-directed recovery.
DualMap [6] connects online open-vocabulary mapping with navigation through a global abstract
map and a local concrete map, and supports candidate reselection when the target is absent.
Its planar abstraction nevertheless does not represent floor transitions or coordinate
relocation hypotheses across floors. MD-SG combines the two lines through an online,
open-vocabulary 3D scene graph that performs evidence-driven belief revision and floor-aware
candidate selection. These mechanisms allow the robot to reconsider both where to search and
which floor to visit.

## III. Methodology

### A. Overview and Problem Formulation

We consider object search in a multi-floor environment whose object configuration may change
after initial exploration. Given a target query and a scene graph constructed during previous
operation, the robot must locate the target while revising object locations that are no
longer supported by current observations. At time $t$, the system receives an RGB image
$I_t$, a depth image $D_t$, and a camera pose $T_t$, and maintains a persistent scene graph
$G_t = (V_t, E_t)$. Its objective is to recover the target through observation-driven search
within and across floors.

MD-SG integrates Presence-Belief Revision with Belief-Guided Search and Unified Selection
within a floor-aware 3D scene graph. The graph stores object geometry, support relations, and
floor connectivity. Presence-Belief Revision reassesses remembered object locations using
current observations. When direct target candidates are rejected, Belief-Guided Search and
Unified Selection prioritizes support-surface inspections and frontier exploration using
scene priors, inspection evidence, and travel cost. A multi-floor policy uses the remaining
support for candidate locations to coordinate floor transitions. Observations gathered during
navigation update the same scene memory, closing the loop between belief revision and
subsequent search.

### B. Hierarchical 3D Scene Graph

The scene graph records object geometry, support relations, and floor connectivity. We use
RTAB-Map [10] as the geometric mapping backend in both simulation and real-world experiments.

#### 1) Perception Frontend

Pose-selected keyframes are processed by an open-vocabulary detection channel and a
class-agnostic proposal channel. We use YOLOE [11] to segment prompted indoor categories and
the target, and FastSAM [12] with MobileCLIP [13] to provide additional query-relevant
regions. The fused masks are back-projected using depth to form object observations. Tracks
enter the graph after repeated supporting observations, with channel-specific admission
criteria accounting for differences between detector confidence and image–language
similarity.

#### 2) Object Representation

Following VOOM [14], each object track $i$ is represented by a dual-quadric ellipsoid $Q_i$,
initialized from one observation and refined across views. Its projected ellipse,
parameterized by $(\mu_i, \Sigma_i)$, supports Wasserstein-based association and the
visibility assessment in Section III-C.

We adapt this representation to target-driven navigation with two constraints. Associations
require category agreement to preserve the semantics used for target retrieval. In addition,
navigation may provide a narrow range of viewing angles, which leaves geometric refinement
poorly constrained. We reject refinements that displace the ellipsoid center by more than
$\alpha_{\max} = 0.5\ \mathrm{m}$ from its preceding estimate.

#### 3) Scene Hierarchy

Containment relations organize the graph into four levels: floor, room, container, and
object. Object nodes reference their underlying tracks, sharing geometry and presence state.
Floors are identified primarily from the agent's standing height. Peaks in the ground-height
representation may additionally identify visible but unvisited floors. Within each floor,
doorway-scale morphological erosion separates connected free space into room regions.

Container nodes represent support surfaces that may hold a target. Support-surface
eligibility for a mapped object $o$ is defined as follows:

$$
o \in \mathcal{S} \iff \ell_o \in \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{sup}}
\ \wedge\ h_{\min} \le h_o \le h_{\max}
\ \wedge\ A_o \ge A_{\min},
\tag{1}
$$

where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of eligible support surfaces, $\ell_o$ the object category,
$\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{sup}}$ the support-category set, $h_o$ the top height bounded by
$h_{\min}$ and $h_{\max}$, and $A_o$ the ground-plane footprint area bounded below by
$A_{\min}$. Joint semantic and geometric filtering reduces spurious search locations.
Same-category surface fragments are merged using footprint overlap relative to their spatial
extent. The graph, track beliefs, and floor connectivity are retained across missions.

#### 4) Cross-floor Connectivity

Stair connections augment the containment hierarchy with floor-level edges. Each confirmed
connection is stored as follows:

$$
e_{\mathrm{stair}} = (\varphi_{\mathrm{from}},\ \varphi_{\mathrm{to}},\
x_{\mathrm{entry}},\ x_{\mathrm{exit}}),
\tag{2}
$$

where $e_{\mathrm{stair}}$ denotes a stair edge, $\varphi_{\mathrm{from}}$ and
$\varphi_{\mathrm{to}}$ the source and destination floors, and $x_{\mathrm{entry}}$ and
$x_{\mathrm{exit}}$ the entry and exit positions. An edge is added only after a completed
traversal, which distinguishes confirmed connectivity from candidate transitions.

Before traversal, the height representation provides two complementary cues: stair masks
capture steppable height changes, while stair flights group connected intermediate-height
cells to estimate candidate endpoints, including flat tread regions. Detected staircase
tracks provide additional supporting evidence. Geometric portals indicate potentially visible
floors but do not establish traversability. Fig. 3 illustrates these cues.

> **Fig. 3** — Height cues on one staircase. Colored dots mark the *stair flight*, the set of
> connected intermediate-height cells recovered from the height representation. The two circles
> denote its lowest and highest cells, the candidate endpoints. **(a)** The lowest cell serves
> as the entry position $x_{\mathrm{entry}}$, the *stair mask* marks the steppable height change
> at each riser, and the flat tread interiors are supplied by the flight. **(b)** During
> descent, the same flight reduces to a sliver of tread at the edge of the frame. The entry
> position therefore lies at the flight's highest cell. A stair edge (Eq. 2) is added only after
> the traversal completes and certifies traversability.

### C. Presence-Belief Revision

Presence-Belief Revision estimates whether an object remains at its mapped location. A missed
detection alone cannot establish absence, since the object may be occluded or outside a
reliable viewing region. We therefore gate negative evidence by observation eligibility,
allowing informative misses to reduce belief while leaving uninformative observations
unchanged.

#### 1) Visibility-gated Evidence

Let $L_i$ denote the bounded log-odds score of track $i$, with presence score
$p_i = \sigma(L_i)$ and $\sigma$ the sigmoid function. Let $Z_i = 1$ indicate a detection
assigned to the track's projected extent. Each detection contributes to at most one track.
The eligibility indicator $E_i = 1$ denotes an observation from which the object could have
been detected at its mapped location. Given recall $r_i$ and false-alarm rate $q$, evidence
is accumulated as follows:

$$
\Delta L_i =
\begin{cases}
\log(r_i / q), & Z_i = 1,\\[2pt]
\log\!\big((1 - r_i)/(1 - q)\big), & Z_i = 0,\ E_i = 1,\\[2pt]
0, & Z_i = 0,\ E_i = 0,
\end{cases}
\tag{3}
$$

where $\Delta L_i$ denotes the evidence increment for track $i$, $Z_i$ the detection
indicator, $E_i$ the eligibility indicator, $r_i$ the view-dependent recall, and $q$ the
false-alarm rate. Detections thus support presence, whereas misses reduce belief only when
the observation is informative. Recall depends on apparent object size, range, and viewing
angle.

Eligibility requires a sufficiently large, readable projection within a reliable detection
range. Depth further distinguishes occlusion from an exposed location. Along the central
viewing ray, the near boundary is $z_{\mathrm{near}} = z_c - e_i - \delta$, where $z_c$ is
center depth, $e_i$ is the extent toward the camera, and $\delta$ is a tolerance. If a
sufficient fraction of valid projected depths lies closer than this boundary, the expected
object is occluded and $E_i = 0$. Background depths beyond the expected object do not exclude
the observation, which allows a miss at an exposed location to reduce belief. Fig. 4(a–c)
illustrates these cases.

#### 2) Bounded Updates and Arrival Verification

The accumulated evidence is clipped asymmetrically as follows:

$$
L_i \leftarrow \operatorname{clip}(L_i + \Delta L_i,\ L_{\min},\ L_{\max}),
\tag{4}
$$

where $L_i$ is the log-odds score of track $i$, $\Delta L_i$ the evidence increment, and
$L_{\min}$ and $L_{\max}$ the lower and upper bounds, with $L_{\min} < 0 < L_{\max}$ and
$|L_{\min}| > L_{\max}$. The positive ceiling limits confidence accumulated from historical
sightings, which allows subsequent misses to revise an outdated location. The lower bound
suppresses rejected locations while permitting recovery through renewed detections. We use
$p_i$ as a bounded decision score, without assuming a calibrated posterior.

Arrival verification uses the same update with observer-specific reliability parameters. A
readable view that confirms target absence supplies negative evidence through a
vision-language observer or an eligible detector scan. An unreadable view supplies no absence
evidence. A failed VLM call is not treated as a negative observation. An eligible detector
scan may instead provide the arrival reading. These alternative arrival observers complement
keyframe evidence, as illustrated in Fig. 4(d–e).

> **Fig. 4** — Presence belief update with MD-SG. Visibility and multi-sensor presence

> matched sighting raises belief. (d) Keyframe detector misses and one arrival observer feed the
> same bounded update. (e) An illustrative trajectory uses configured sensor reliabilities. The
> VLM and detector fallback are alternatives.

### D. Belief-Guided Search and Unified Selection

Search proceeds in two stages. The robot first considers mapped target tracks whose presence
scores exceed a threshold. Eligible tracks are ranked by presence, with accumulated track
evidence breaking ties when scores reach their bounds. A separate rejection count handles
repeated arrivals at physically present but query-incompatible objects. When no eligible
direct target candidate remains, the robot considers mapped support surfaces and reachable
frontiers. Surface candidates encode plausible target locations, while frontiers provide
opportunities to discover unmapped locations. A shared utility balances their search value
against geodesic travel cost.

#### 1) Search Candidates

Let $\mathcal{F}$ denote reachable frontiers on the current floor and $\mathcal{S}$ its
eligible support surfaces. Frontier relevance $P_j$ combines an exploration prior,
information gain, and heading continuity. In the evaluated configuration, these terms are
geometric and independent of the target category. The support-surface score $b(x)$ is defined
as follows:

$$
b(x) = a(x)\,\kappa(\ell^\star, \ell_x)^{\gamma}
\exp\!\left(-\frac{\lVert c_x - c_{\mathrm{last}} \rVert}{L}\right),
\tag{5}
$$

where $a(x)$ indicates geometric compatibility with the target, $\kappa$ measures affinity
between target category $\ell^\star$ and surface category $\ell_x$, and $\gamma < 1$ softens
that affinity. The distance term favors proximity of the surface location $c_x$ to the
target's last mapped position $c_{\mathrm{last}}$, with scale $L$. Robot travel is accounted
for separately. The score $b(x)$ expresses prior search preference rather than a calibrated
probability. We obtain $\tilde{b}(x)$ by peak normalization at a fixed reference scale and
then apply inspection discounts. Keeping this scale fixed preserves the reduction in search
priority caused by unsuccessful inspections.

#### 2) Unified Utility and Inspection Memory

Let $c(g)$ be the geodesic travel cost to candidate $g$, $d(x)$ the estimated probability of
detecting a target present on surface $x$ during inspection, and $\rho(x)$ a persistent
inspection discount. Candidate utility is defined as follows:

$$
U(g) =
\begin{cases}
\beta\,P_j \,/\, c(f_j), & g = f_j \in \mathcal{F},\\[3pt]
\tilde{b}(x)\,\rho(x)\,d(x) \,/\, c(x), & g = x \in \mathcal{S},
\end{cases}
\tag{6}
$$

where $U(g)$ denotes the utility of candidate $g$, $c(g)$ the geodesic travel cost, $P_j$ the
relevance of frontier $f_j \in \mathcal{F}$, $\beta$ the coefficient that balances frontier
exploration against surface inspection, and $\tilde{b}(x)$, $\rho(x)$, and $d(x)$ the
normalized surface score, the inspection discount, and the detection probability of surface
$x \in \mathcal{S}$. The preferred candidate is selected as
$g^\star = \arg\max_{g \in \mathcal{F} \cup \mathcal{S}} U(g)$. Candidates are shortlisted by
relevance before geodesic costs are evaluated.

After an unsuccessful inspection, the surface discount is updated as follows:

$$
\rho(x) \leftarrow \rho(x)\,\big(1 - d(x)\big),
\tag{7}
$$

where $\rho(x)$ denotes the persistent inspection discount of surface $x$ and $d(x)$ its
detection probability during inspection. The discount records negative inspection evidence
across search attempts. An unsuccessful inspection with low detection probability only weakly
reduces the surface's priority, whereas a reliable negative inspection produces a larger
reduction. As inspected surfaces lose priority, frontier exploration receives higher priority
relative to surface inspection under the same utility.

### E. Multi-Floor Navigation Policy

The multi-floor navigation policy converts the per-surface beliefs maintained by the
preceding modules into a decision about which floor to search. Stable floor identifiers
associate support surfaces with floor-specific candidate sets $\mathcal{S}_\varphi$, and the
score of each nonempty set is defined as follows:

$$
M_\varphi = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}_\varphi|}
\sum_{x \in \mathcal{S}_\varphi} \tilde{b}(x)\,\rho(x)\,d(x),
\tag{8}
$$

where $\mathcal{S}_\varphi$ denotes the candidate surfaces on floor $\varphi$, and
$\tilde{b}(x)$, $\rho(x)$, and $d(x)$ are the normalized surface score, the inspection
discount, and the detection probability from Section III-D. The preferred floor is selected
as $\varphi^\star = \arg\max_{\varphi : |\mathcal{S}_\varphi| > 0} M_\varphi$, and the mean
prevents floors with more support surfaces from being favored on that basis alone.

A floor switch requires the leading floor to exceed the current one by a score margin.
Switching is deferred while a credible, untested target track remains on the current floor
under the presence criterion of Section III-D. Each unsuccessful inspection weakens these
local candidates, and the switch is granted once another floor leads by the required margin.
Timing constraints additionally suppress repeated or late transitions. Route selection for an
accepted switch rests on a single principle: a floor transition is only as reliable as the
evidence that certifies it. The policy therefore prefers height-derived stair flights, whose
entry points and tread geometry are recovered directly from the height representation, over
detected staircase tracks, which contribute semantic evidence, and over geometric portals,
which reveal a visible floor rather than a traversable path. The scene graph records a stair
edge (Eq. 2) only for transitions that the robot has completed. Local inspection evidence
thus redirects the search across floors while unverified connections remain excluded.

## IV. Experimental Results

### A. Experimental Settings

**Datasets.** We evaluate MD-SG on the dynamic HM3D dataset [15]. For single-floor dynamic
navigation, we utilize the environments constructed by DualMap [6], which employs custom
tools built upon the Habitat Simulator [16]. Object changes are categorized into two types:
in-anchor relocation, where an object is moved within the same anchor (e.g., shifting a cup
on a table), and cross-anchor relocation, where an object is transferred to a different
anchor (e.g., from a table to a shelf). We specifically focus on cross-anchor relocations, as
the spatial displacement of in-anchor relocations is too minor to rigorously validate our
dynamic handling pipeline. For multi-floor dynamic navigation, we construct novel
environments using the same toolkit employed by DualMap [6]. The resulting benchmark
comprises 25 cross-floor relocation episodes across five scenes, and each episode is
evaluated as an independent ObjectNav episode for the compared methods. Fig. 5 visualizes one
episode of each relocation mode together with the generation protocol.

**Metrics.** To evaluate the performance of object navigation tasks, we report Success Rate
(SR). Following the evaluation criteria of DualMap [6], an episode is considered successful
if the agent terminates within 1.0 meter of the target object. In dynamic scenes, success
additionally requires locating the target within three attempts. The multi-floor benchmark
additionally reports Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), which scales success by the ratio
of the shortest-path length to the actual path length. Single-floor episodes use a 500-step
budget, and multi-floor episodes use 1,000 steps to account for the longer paths that
cross-floor search requires.

**Compared Methods.** For our baseline comparisons, we include ConceptGraphs [5] and HOV-SG
[4]. Since our experimental setup strictly aligns with DualMap [6], we directly report the
performance metrics for these two methods as evaluated in their work. As noted in DualMap
[6], both baselines were explicitly extended in the Habitat Simulator to support navigation
using identical planning algorithms, ensuring a fair and consistent comparison. For DualMap
[6], we utilize its official open-source implementation. The re-evaluation over three seeds
follows the exact success criteria defined in their paper. It reproduces the published
in-anchor result exactly (64.8%) and the static result within 3.4 points (67.1% vs. 70.5%),
while the cross-anchor result falls to 30.2% against the published 60.3%. Table I accordingly
reports both the originally published metrics and the re-evaluated results under the unified
experimental setup.

**Implementation Details.** Our experiments are conducted in the Habitat simulator [16],
running on a workstation equipped with an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU and an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU.
We adopt ASCENT [2] as our base navigation pipeline. Following their configuration, we
utilize D-FINE [17] and Grounding-DINO [18] for object detection, and Mobile-SAM [19] for
object segmentation. For comprehensive scene understanding and frontier reasoning, we employ
Places365 [20] for scene classification, RAM [21] for object tagging, BLIP-2 [22] for
semantic similarity, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct [23] for handling language queries. Furthermore,
to construct and maintain our dynamic 3D scene graph, we specifically employ YOLOE-11L-seg
[11] and FastSAM-s [12] paired with MobileCLIP-S2 [13] for open-vocabulary object detection
and segmentation.

### B. Simulation Experiment Results

Table I compares MD-SG with the semantic-map and scene-graph baselines across static,
in-anchor, and cross-anchor conditions, and MD-SG's relative standing improves as the
condition demands more relocation handling. In the static setting, which exercises mapping
quality alone, MD-SG outperforms ConceptGraphs [5] and HOV-SG [4] and performs on par with
re-evaluated DualMap [6] (64.6% vs. 67.1%). In-anchor displacements leave remembered
locations approximately valid, and MD-SG remains comparable to DualMap (63.0% vs. 64.8%).
Cross-anchor relocation invalidates the remembered location entirely, the condition where
presence revision and belief-guided reselection matter most, and MD-SG reaches 52.8% against
30.2% for DualMap re-evaluated under the same protocol, the largest margin.

Table II extends the evaluation to cross-floor relocation, where MD-SG recovers relocated
targets that the base pipeline cannot. Here, a switch requires the leading floor to exceed
the current one by a 15% margin on mean surface score, and is permitted only once per 50
steps, between steps 50 and 700 of the 1000-step budget. Recovery in this setting demands
exactly the two capabilities our pipeline introduces: revising the presence belief of a
remembered location and comparing the remaining hypotheses across floors before redirecting
the search. MD-SG reaches a success rate of 40.0% with an SPL of 0.162. ASCENT, the base
pipeline without these mechanisms, retains no prior-layout memory to revise, and fails to
recover any relocated target within the same budget.

### C. Ablation Study

The ablation targets the three components that MD-SG introduces for dynamic handling:
presence-belief revision, belief-guided surface scoring, and VLM-based absence verification.
Each is removed in turn, and the resulting pipeline is evaluated in the cross-anchor
condition, where these mechanisms are exercised most. Table III locates the gain in the
reject-and-redirect loop that the two belief mechanisms form, rather than in any single
component. Without presence-belief revision, the agent continues to act on stale locations.
All seven lost episodes commit to a prior-map track and the stale belief never decays, the
success rate falls from 52.8% to 41.5%. Without belief-guided surface scoring, the stale
hypothesis is correctly rejected but rejection frees the search without directing it, and the
agent falls back to frontier exploration. The success rate falls further to 35.8%, the
largest individual drop.

**TABLE III** — Contribution of Individual Mechanisms on the single-floor cross-anchor dataset

| Options | SR |
|---|---|
| w/o Presence-Belief Revision | 41.5% |
| w/o Belief-Guided Surface Scoring | 35.8% |
| w/o VLM-Based Absence Verification | 52.8% |
| **Full System** | **52.8%** |

The two contributions are not strictly additive, as belief-guided surface scoring becomes
most useful after an outdated hypothesis has been rejected. Moreover, belief-guided surface
scoring primarily improves candidate ordering rather than explicitly directing the robot
toward the highest-scored surfaces. In contrast, disabling VLM-based absence verification
leaves the success rate unchanged. Both configurations reach 52.8%. Further inspection shows
that the verification module is invoked only five times across 53 episodes, which indicates
that it is rarely activated under the current pipeline rather than inherently ineffective.
Even the weakest ablated variant remains above re-evaluated DualMap in the same condition
(35.8% vs. 30.2%), which separates two layers of gain: the floor-aware pipeline itself
already improves over the planar baseline, and the belief mechanisms contribute the rest.
These results identify presence-belief revision and belief-guided surface scoring as the
primary mechanisms behind MD-SG's improvement under dynamic object relocation.

### D. Real-World Deployment

To validate that our pipeline can handle dynamic environments and efficiently locate
relocated targets, we deployed MD-SG on a wheeled robot equipped with an RGB-D camera and
NVIDIA AGX Thor for model inference. As illustrated in Fig. 6, during the initial exploration
phase, the robot observed a blue bottle on Table A and an empty Table B. Subsequently, upon
receiving the language query target 'blue bottle,' the robot first navigated to Table A to
verify the target's presence. Upon detecting its absence, the MD-SG pipeline inferred a high
probability that the bottle had been moved to Table B. Consequently, the robot navigated to
Table B and successfully located the bottle.

## V. Conclusion

We presented MD-SG, an online, open-vocabulary 3D scene graph navigation pipeline for dynamic
multi-floor ObjectNav, and showed that representing remembered object locations as revisable
beliefs, rather than fixed map entries, enables an agent to recover relocated targets within
and across floors. By combining presence belief updates, belief-guided candidate selection,
and floor-aware navigation, MD-SG connects the rejection of outdated locations with the
search that follows. The experimental results demonstrated improved single-floor cross-anchor
recovery over re-evaluated DualMap, and the cross-floor benchmark and real-world
demonstration extended the evaluation to multi-floor relocation and physical deployment. The
results position revisable, floor-aware scene memory as a first-class design axis for object
navigation in changing multi-floor environments. The proposed benchmark provides a direct way
to measure this capability and opens a concrete avenue for future research on dynamic
multi-floor object navigation.

## Appendix B — number → run provenance

The arm is `+experiment=dualmap_osg_unified` for the single-floor tables and
`+experiment=mf5_osg_on_ascent_map` for the multi-floor one. SR is the mean of the `success`
field over `episodes.jsonl` (`eval/metrics.py:13` `aggregate`), which is DualMap's released
rule — a stop within 1.0 m of the object, within three attempts — not Habitat's 0.18 m
viewpoint rule.

| paper row | expected | run directory | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Table I, Ours, in-anchor 63.0% | 34 / 54 | `outputs/osg_v4_fuse_cls_full` | **reproduces** (part of 62/107) |
| Table I, Ours, cross-anchor 52.8% | 28 / 53 | `outputs/osg_v4_fuse_cls_full` | **reproduces** (part of 62/107) |
| Table II, ASCENT 0% / 0 | 0 / 25 | `outputs/ascent_crossanchor` | **reproduces** |
| Table I, Ours, static 64.6% | 51 / 79 | — | **not on this machine**: no 78- or 79-episode run exists under `outputs/` |
| Table II, Ours 40.0% / 0.162 | 10 / 25 | — | **not reconciled**: the best multi-floor run here is `outputs/mf5_pass2_final` at 9/25 = 36.0%, SPL 0.1384 (2 + 7 + 7 + 3 + 6 episodes over the five scenes, no duplicate ids, agreeing with each scene's own `summary.json`) |
| Table III, w/o presence revision 41.5% | 22 / 53 | — | **not on this machine**: no 53-episode run exists |
| Table III, w/o surface scoring 35.8% | 19 / 53 | — | **not on this machine** |
| Table III, w/o VLM verification 52.8% | 28 / 53 | — | **not on this machine** as a separate run |

The three ablations are re-runnable as one override each on the full arm:

```bash
python scripts/run_eval.py +experiment=dualmap_osg_unified \
    scene_graph.presence.enabled=false          # w/o Presence-Belief Revision
python scripts/run_eval.py +experiment=dualmap_osg_unified \
    exploration.search_posterior=false          # w/o Belief-Guided Surface Scoring
python scripts/run_eval.py +experiment=dualmap_osg_unified \
    verification=off                            # w/o VLM-Based Absence Verification
```

Two smaller disagreements, recorded rather than resolved:

- Table I gives the static condition **78** trials (26 per scene, which is what the
  per-scene percentages divide into). `docs/DUALMAP_OFFICIAL_RERUN.md` gives **79**.
- `configs/experiment/mf5_osg_unified.yaml` still lists scene **00808**, and its comment says
  **26** relocations. The paper's five scenes are 00800, 00821, **00862**, 00873, 00878, and
  it reports **25** episodes. `configs/experiment/mf5_ascent_crossanchor.yaml` already names
  00862. Both scenes exist under the collector's multi-floor root.

## Appendix C — naming, and one note on Eq. 8

**MD-SG is OSG.** The paper's system name does not appear in the code, which says `osg`
throughout — the package, the config namespace, and every preset. Renaming would rotate all
87 preset fingerprints and 505 pinned configuration keys in
`tests/unit/golden/` for no measured gain, so the code keeps its name and this file records
the mapping.

| paper | code |
|---|---|
| MD-SG | the `osg` package; the `nav_agent` policy on the `dualmap_osg_unified` / `mf5_osg_on_ascent_map` arms |
| Presence-Belief Revision | `objects/presence.py`, wired by `pipeline/beliefs.py` |
| Belief-Guided Search and Unified Selection | `exploration/search_belief.py` + `exploration/strategy.py` |
| Multi-Floor Navigation Policy | `agent/floor_policy.py` + `mapping/portals.py` |
| ASCENT, the base pipeline | `src/navigation/`, a line-by-line transcription (see its README for the F1–F14 fidelity notes) |

**Why Eq. 8 takes the mean.** The code comment beside it records the measurement that chose
it. On 00808's prior map, over five targets, floor 0 held 78 surfaces summing to 52.5 and
floor 1 held 33 summing to 22.3 — means of 0.673 and 0.676, agreeing to within half a
percent. The container priors carry essentially no information about *which storey*. A sum
turns that tie into a 2.4× preference for the larger floor, so an agent upstairs asks to go
down every round whatever it is looking for. The mean makes the score scale-free and the 15%
margin then requires another storey to be decisively better, which together let the posterior
return "no opinion" — on this evidence the honest answer — and leave the storey choice to the
mechanisms that do carry floor information.
