# The close-look A/B (docs/SR_PROPOSAL_CLOSE_LOOK.md): three arms x three scenes,
# dynamic trials only, paired against the tight-ring baseline already on disk
# at outputs/osg_dualmap_tightring. Each (arm, scene) is one process because the
# prior map is per scene; MAX_PARALLEL bounds how many share the GPU.
#
#   scripts/run_close_look_ab.sh              # the working configuration, 3 scenes
#   MAX_PARALLEL=4 ARMS="tightring flat_anchor_v2_island_close" scripts/run_close_look_ab.sh
#   TRIAL_SET=data/splits/dualmap_hard.json MAX_STEPS=300 ARMS=flat_anchor_v2_island \
#     OUT_ROOT=outputs/osg_hard scripts/run_close_look_ab.sh
#
# TRIAL_SET restricts each scene to the trial ids in a subset file written by
# scripts/make_hard_subset.py -- the failures a mechanism is aimed at, which
# are also the trials that run to the budget and cost 68% of a full batch --
# so an arm pairs against any full run on those ids and finishes in about an
# hour instead of five. MAX_STEPS caps the episode budget (agent.max_steps,
# 500 shipped) for mechanism-only iteration: the search-order gate is read in
# the first ~150 steps, and a 300-step cap cuts the failures' cost by ~40%
# while forfeiting the 6-7 of 107 successes that land after step 300. Results
# under either are for iterating, not for reporting. DRY_RUN=1 prints the
# commands and runs nothing.
#
# An arm named X runs the preset `${PRESET_PREFIX}X` (default prefix
# `dualmap_protocol_osg_look_`), so a new arm is a new preset and nothing else.
# Reads the hosted-VLM credential from .env; outputs land under
# $OUT_ROOT/<arm>/<scene>/, logs beside them. Idempotent: an (arm, scene)
# whose episodes.jsonl already holds the scene's trials is skipped, so a
# crashed batch is resumed by running the script again.
