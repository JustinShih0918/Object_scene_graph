"""Our detector against DualMap's, on the frames our agent actually failed on.

DualMap names objects ours never does -- it scores `scissors` 9/18 on the
released benchmark where we score 1/18 -- and three explanations were live:
the name we hand the detector, the classes competing for the object's pixels,
and the model itself. `scripts/probe_nearmiss.py` has now closed the first two:
swapping in nine alternative names for the soup can moved recall by three
frames, and removing all thirteen competing classes moved it by zero, on four
different targets. That leaves the model.

This runs DualMap's own detector -- `yolov8l-world.pt` against its 305-class
list, both taken from the vendored checkout the benchmark ran from -- over the
same dumped keyframes, and asks the same question ours was asked: did anything
labelled with the target cover the object's projected pixel, and at what score.

It is not a like-for-like architecture comparison and is not meant to be. It is
the question that decides where the perception work goes: if DualMap's detector
also fails these frames, our ceiling is the benchmark's and the remaining work
is elsewhere; if it names them, the detector is the work.
