"""The hard subset: the trials an experiment can actually move, and nothing else.

A full arm on the released benchmark is 107 dynamic trials and about five hours
of process time, and 68% of that is the failures that run to the 500-step
budget. Those failures are also the only trials a search-order or approach
change is aimed at; the successes and the trials no mechanism touches are
paid for every run and never change the answer.

This writes a trial list picked by rule from a reference run, so an arm can be
run on the subset and still be paired, trial by trial, against any full run:

  hard_cross     cross-anchor trials where the target was never named in the
                 reference run -- the search never brought it into a usable
                 view (the population of every search-order arm)
  cross_named    cross-anchor trials named and still failed
  inanchor_leave in-anchor trials whose first commit was already within 1 m
                 of the object and which still failed (the arrive-and-leave
                 population of the look before absence)
  inanchor_other the remaining in-anchor failures

`--rules` picks which of those go in. The output records the rule, the
reference run and each trial's reference outcome, so a later reader knows what
the subset was selected on. Selection on a reference run's outcome is a
selection on noise as well as on difficulty -- a trial that failed once by
chance is in, one that scored once by chance is out -- so subset results are
for iterating on a mechanism, and the full 107 remain the number reported.
