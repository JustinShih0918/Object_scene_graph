"""Is the prior map good enough to run pass 2 on? Answered in numbers, per storey.

The cross-anchor experiment kept failing for a reason upstream of the
navigation: the map. On 00800 the kept obstacle snapshot covered 51% of the
lower storey and five of twelve authored target positions fell 2-5 m outside
it; on 00808 no mapping episode visited both storeys, so the scene graph
recorded its "upper" storey at 1.03 m when the real ones are 0.06 and 3.0.
Both were found by hand, after the GPU had been spent. This is the instrument
that finds them first.

Per scene, per storey, against the scene's own navmesh:

  free / occupied / unknown   what the pasted map calls each navigable point
  storeys                     navmesh truth vs what the union actually covers
  stairs                      cells and the span of the pasted ramp
  graph                       scene-graph layer, its tracks, its YCB targets
  targets                     every authored position, in BOTH layouts: which
                              storey, which cell, how far to mapped free space

FREE IS COVERAGE; OCCUPIED IS SOMETHING ELSE. They are different questions and
they get different gates. A navmesh-navigable point the map calls FREE is floor
the planner can use. A navmesh-navigable point it calls OCCUPIED is the planner
being *blocked* from floor that exists -- which on a correct map is furniture:
ASCENT stamps a 0.61-0.88 m band, and a table top over navigable floor lands in
it. Measured on the correct 00800 union, lower storey 0.000 and upper 0.040,
steady from the second snapshot on while free climbed 0.742 -> 0.876.

So occupied alone does NOT detect a transposed paste, and reading the log's
"0.04-0.05 transposed" as a threshold would have been wrong. What separates the
two is FREE: the transposed map read free 0.04 where the correct one reads 0.80.
Both are reported; both are gated; neither is collapsed into the other. And
"mapped" is never defined as `grid != UNKNOWN`, which would merge them into one
number a transposed paste can score well on.

Everything geometric goes through `osg.eval.prior_map.paste_scene`, which is
the paste a run performs, with the costmaps passed in. A second implementation
is exactly how the transposition bug happened, and it must not be reintroduced
for a diagnostic.

No GPU, no Simulator, no perception servers -- a bare `PathFinder` and the
stored snapshots, about two seconds a scene.
