"""Run the pipeline on a real robot, over ROS 2 / Nav2.

Two runs make an experiment, differing in one field:

    python scripts/run_robot.py +experiment=stretch3_map      # explore, keep the map
    python scripts/run_robot.py +experiment=stretch3_search   # load it, find the thing

That is the protocol the whole dynamic-scene line is built around
(docs/DYNAMIC_SCENES.md): run 1 leaves a scene graph and per-storey occupancy;
run 2 starts believing it, and the object has moved. The difference on a robot
is only that the world changes because somebody moved a chair rather than
because a script re-authored a layout.

Separate from `run_eval.py` because a run here is not an evaluation: there is
no episode dataset, no ground truth, nothing to score. What it shares is
everything that matters -- `build_env`, `build_run_components`, `build_agent`
and `run_episode` are the same functions the benchmark uses, so the robot runs
the measured pipeline and not a copy of it.

Needs the bridge up first:

    bash scripts/ros2/bridge.sh                   # a robot, or
    bash scripts/ros2/check_pipeline.sh           # the fake one
