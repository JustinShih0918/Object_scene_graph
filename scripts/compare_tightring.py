"""Did the tighter, extent-aware viewpoint ring convert the near misses?

The expected effect is about nine trials out of 107, which is inside the noise
floor two arms of this size can resolve (docs/AB_RESULTS.md). An SR delta alone
therefore cannot answer the question, and two of five arms in an earlier campaign
returned confident nulls while testing nothing. So this leads with the MECHANISM
counter -- the distance from the placed goal to the object, which the change acts
on directly -- and reports SR second, on the paired trials only.

Read it in this order:

  1. Did the knob move? `goal_to_obj_m` must fall from 0.80. If it did not, the
     ring never engaged and nothing below means anything.
  2. Did it move the right trials? The near-miss band -- committed to the right
     object, stopped between 1.0 and 1.6 m -- is the population the change targets.
  3. Did it cost anything? A ring that is too tight lands in occupied cells,
     `approach_viewpoint` returns None, and the run falls back to a goal that
     historically scored 0.100 against 0.516. `approach_viewpoint_none` is that
     alarm.
