# Pass 1: rebuild the prior maps with the CURRENT vocabulary.
#
# The prior map's tracks carry the query string they were detected under, so a
# vocabulary change invalidates it: a map full of "tomato soup can" tracks holds
# nothing an agent asking for "cylindrical can" can use. save_map overwrites
# rather than merges, so targets accumulate by feeding each episode the map the
# previous one wrote -- the first with map_out alone, the rest with both.
#
# LAYOUT_ROOT picks the world the map is built in, and it is load-bearing.
# `outputs/substituted_layouts` (the default, and what built maps_v5) is the
# released static layout with 037_scissors swapped for 021_bleach_cleanser --
# right for the authored YCB benchmark the swap was made for, and WRONG for
# DualMap's released benchmark, whose episodes inject the real scissors. A map
# built there holds a bleach cleanser at the scissors position and no scissors
# at all. Use `outputs/collector_layouts` for the released benchmark.

# One mapping episode per object the layout actually places, named as OUR
# detector is asked for it. The substituted worlds hunt a bleach bottle where
# the released ones hunt the scissors; the scissors episode will not find it
# (recall 0.00 beyond a metre) and that is the point -- the map then holds what
# the detector can really see in the world the benchmark scores.
# A scene's episodes MUST run in order -- each one starts from the map the
# previous wrote -- but the scenes are independent, so SCENES exists to run one
# per process and cut the wall clock by three. Each needs about 1.3 GB of GPU.
